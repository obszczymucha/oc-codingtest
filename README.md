# Codingtest
Repo for the coding tests we use during our technical interviews.

The build system is Gradle. The gradle wrapper is provided so you don't need to install gradle natively.

## Building
Run ```./gradlew test``` at the project's root

## Password Strength
This is the main exercise module. The aim of this exercise is to make the unit tests pass by implementing the methods in PasswordStrength.java
